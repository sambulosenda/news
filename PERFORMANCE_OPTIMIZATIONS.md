# Performance Optimizations Summary

## PageSpeed Insights Issues Fixed

### Initial Scores (Mobile)
- **Performance Score**: 79 (Poor)
- **LCP**: 4.6s (Failed - should be <2.5s)
- **FCP**: 4.4s (Poor - should be <1.8s)
- **TTFB**: 2.5s (Poor - should be <0.8s)
- **CLS**: 0.19 (Needs improvement)
- **Core Web Vitals**: FAILED ❌

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Font Loading Strategy (Fixed LCP/FCP)
- Changed font display from `optional` to `swap` for immediate text rendering
- Added font fallbacks to prevent invisible text
- Result: Text appears immediately with system fonts, then swaps to custom fonts

### 2. Server Response Time (Fixed TTFB)
- Removed `force-dynamic` from homepage to enable caching
- Increased revalidation time from 10s to 30s for better cache hits
- Added timeout to GraphQL requests (5 seconds)
- Added compression headers for faster data transfer
- Result: Better caching = faster server responses

### 3. Image Optimization (Fixed LCP)
- Added aspect ratio to images to prevent layout shift
- Hero image already has `priority` loading
- CDN URLs properly configured for fast image delivery
- Result: Images load faster and don't cause layout shifts

### 4. Critical CSS (Fixed Render-Blocking)
- Added inline critical CSS in layout.tsx
- Includes skeleton loading styles
- Container styles for above-the-fold content
- Result: Page styles load immediately without waiting for CSS files

### 5. Next.js Config Optimizations
- Enabled CSS optimization (`optimizeCss: true`)
- Enabled scroll restoration
- Added compression
- Optimized image device sizes for mobile
- Result: Smaller bundles and better performance

### 6. Resource Hints
- Preconnect to critical domains (backend, CDN, fonts)
- DNS prefetch for faster domain resolution
- Preload critical resources
- Result: Browser starts connections earlier

## Expected Improvements

After these optimizations, you should see:
- **LCP**: <2.5s ✅ (from 4.6s)
- **FCP**: <1.8s ✅ (from 4.4s)
- **TTFB**: <0.8s ✅ (from 2.5s)
- **CLS**: <0.1 ✅ (from 0.19)
- **Performance Score**: 90+ (from 79)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to production
2. **Re-run PageSpeed Insights** after deployment
3. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** in Search Console over the next 28 days
4. **Consider additional optimizations** if needed:
   - Implement service worker for offline support
   - Add Brotli compression on server
   - Optimize third-party scripts (Google Ads, Analytics)
   - Consider edge caching with Cloudflare or similar

## Testing

To test locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse to test performance locally before deploying.

## Important Notes

- The homepage now caches for 30 seconds instead of 10 seconds
- This means breaking news might take up to 30 seconds to appear
- You can adjust the `revalidate` value in the homepage if needed
- Monitor your actual user metrics in Google Analytics and Search Console
