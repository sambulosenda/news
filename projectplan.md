## Implementation Notes

### Simplicity Principles
1. Each component will be self-contained and focused
2. We'll use existing Tailwind utilities wherever possible
3. GraphQL queries will be simple and specific
4. No over-engineering - focus on working features first

### Key Design Decisions
- **GraphQL Client**: Apollo Client for caching and state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Merriweather for serif, Inter for sans-serif)
- **Image Handling**: next/image with WordPress domain configuration
- **State Management**: React hooks and Apollo cache only

### WordPress/WPGraphQL Considerations
- Ensure all queries handle nullable fields
- Featured images will come from WordPress media library
- Categories and tags will map to our sections
- Author information will be fetched with posts

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Homepage loads with real WordPress content
- [ ] Articles display with proper formatting
- [ ] Navigation works across all sections
- [ ] Site is responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds
- [ ] SEO meta tags properly implemented
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Clean, professional appearance matching NYTimes aesthetic
